In Progress
- get user by id when on account server side

Next
- add an "error dashboard" so if there are errors in server, we can view them
- if I have the html editor up on page load, and I exit out, I can't get the other content to show


Future
- after sign up, send an email to verify

Done

Testing

Browser Fixes

Mobile Fixes

Ideas
- make login a popup from the top (like southwest.com)
    - remove the errors when a user leaves the form, only show error if the submit button is hit
    - when logging in, remove form and put a spinner instead
    - when correct login, login like normal
    - when incorrect login, show form with error
- User can only change Hubs every so often (to prevent people from continuously changing)
