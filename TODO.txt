In Progress
- finsih account getting/updating on server side

Next
- add a "confirm password" input during a sign up
- add an "error dashboard" so if there are errors in server, we can view them
- if I have the html editor up on page load, and I exit out, I can't get the other content to show
- use 'https://api.ipify.org?format=json' if can't use other tool to get ip address
- when a user purchases a membership, then set maxHubs
- instead of sending a huge amount of data over server (for hubs) just send iata and icao adn then on front end do a lookup

Future
- after sign up, send an email to verify
- when some request validations depend on one another find a way to not test each one, and instead, if one is validated, then test the other.
    (if cc number needs to be string, 16 long and valid, then if its not a string, don't even test 16 long or valid)

Done


Testing

Browser Fixes

Mobile Fixes

Ideas
- make login a popup from the top (like southwest.com)
    - remove the errors when a user leaves the form, only show error if the submit button is hit
    - when logging in, remove form and put a spinner instead
    - when correct login, login like normal
    - when incorrect login, show form with error
- User can only change Hubs every so often (to prevent people from continuously changing)

 $routeProvider.when('/someRoute', {
    templateUrl: 'someTemplate.html',
    resolve: {
        factory: checkAuth
    }
 });


var checkAuth = function ($q, $rootScope, $location) {
    var deferred = $q.defer();

    if authenticated
        $location.path('/login');
        deferred.resolve(true);
    else
        deferred.reject();
        $location.path('/home');
    return deferred.promise;
 };
