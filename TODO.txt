In Progress


Next
- create each module necessary
- make an admin folder and move dashboard under that
- add an "error dashboard" so if there are errors in server, we can view them
- read from DB always instead of reading only on start of server
- make sure all authenticated routes get authenticated before logging
- add roles to user

Future

Done

Testing

Browser Fixes

Mobile Fixes


Ideas
- make login a popup from the top (like southwest.com)
    - remove the errors when a user leaves the form, only show error if the submit button is hit
    - when logging in, remove form and put a spinner instead
    - when correct login, login like normal
    - when incorrect login, show form with error
- User can only change Hubs every so often (to prevent people from continuously changing)
