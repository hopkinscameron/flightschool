In Progress
- finsih account getting/updating on server side

Next
- add an "error dashboard" so if there are errors in server, we can view them
- if I have the html editor up on page load, and I exit out, I can't get the other content to show
- use 'https://api.ipify.org?format=json' if can't use other tool to get ip address
- if signin/signup failed, clear password
- for isBoolean, use below
    req.checkBody({
        'key': {
            isBoolean: {
                errorMessage: 'should be a boolean'
            }
        }
    });
- when a user purchases a membership, then set maxHubs
- instead of sending a huge amount of data over server (for hubs) just send iata and icao adn then on front end do a lookup

Future
- after sign up, send an email to verify

Done

Testing

Browser Fixes

Mobile Fixes

Ideas
- make login a popup from the top (like southwest.com)
    - remove the errors when a user leaves the form, only show error if the submit button is hit
    - when logging in, remove form and put a spinner instead
    - when correct login, login like normal
    - when incorrect login, show form with error
- User can only change Hubs every so often (to prevent people from continuously changing)
